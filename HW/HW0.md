# HW0

This homework will prepare you for basic setup in the course.

## Basic course setup (40)

##### Stack Overflow+Mattermost+Moodle (10)

Properly setting up your Mattermost and Moodle profile by providing a picture will help the teaching staff learn your name. Upload a current headshot picture of you (not anyone else, not a cartoon picture of you, etc.) to your Moodle profile. For Slack, make sure you have your first and last name as part of your profile. Use [US passport photo guidelines](http://travel.state.gov/passport/pptphotoreq/photocomptemplate/photocomptemplate_5297.html).

For **Stack Overflow Teams**, providing a profile picture is optional.

##### Github (5)

Sign into [NCSU's GitHub](https://github.ncsu.edu/).

1. Create a *private* repo called HW0-510. 
2. Go to Settings, Collaborators and Teams, and add the TAs and instructor as a collaborator (using their unity id).

##### Asking a Question, Answering a Question (5)

Practice asking a question (Q) on Stack Overflow Teams. Provide an answer (A) to at least one question on Stack Overflow Teams.

##### Opunit checks (20)

* Acheive 100% pass rate for opunit profile checks:

```sh
opunit profile CSC-DevOps/profile:510.yml
```

Include screenshot of command output in your submission.

## Engineering Basics workshop (50)

Complete the engineering basics workshop.

##### Shells (20)

For full credit, pass the opunit checks:

```sh
opunit verify local
```

##### Learning Git (20)

Solve the first four levels in: http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/

![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/742934/9494425/c4dd4b66-4bd3-11e5-9aac-04bfc8fed771.png)

* Introduction Sequence (5%)
* Ramping Up (5%)
* Moving Work Around (5%)
* A Mixed Bag (5%)

For _extra credit_, complete "Advanced Topics". (+10%)

For submission, you only need to demonstrate completing the levels, which can be done taking a screenshot. However, you should keep track of your solutions to help you remember how to solve these types of issues in the future, or recover if your progress gets lost.

##### Create a GitHub issue (10)

Create a github issue that keeps track of your hw0 tasks.  Use markdown to annotate the issue.

Remember, you can use the `[ ] task` notation, to create a simple todo list.

```
- [ ] Upload moodle picture
- [ ] Setup Stack Overflow Teams...
- ...
```

## Screencast (10)

Create a short (less than 1 minute) screencast demoing your opunit course profile check running. See screencast guidelines below.

## Submiting your homework

Submit a link to your github repo to [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8X1vVHvrqLxsbs_6ujD3YC3W7DljxS9EaymdGuRzI28Zwhg/viewform?usp=sf_link),
containing the following:

Inside your repo, ensure you have a README.md that contains information necessary for demonstrating you have completed the following components:

* Basic course setup (40)
* Engineering basics workshop (50)
* Screencast (10)

You can provide your answers (in markdown), include screenshots (e.g., for opunit check), or links (e.g.,for your question on Stack Overflow Teams) in this process.

Include a link to your screencast video, hosted on a video site (unlisted) or linked on google drive. Ensure TAs and instructors have appropriate viewing permissions.

**Due Friday**, 9/6, before midnight.

## Screencasts Guidelines

Here are some guidelines and links for creating good screencasts. It is good to get ready now to learn how to create demo videos for your future project milestones and career.

A general guideline: Do whatever it would do if you were teaching someone how to do something. For example, you donâ€™t have to show people you typing and creating the whole commit, but you might want to show the contents of the hook in a text editor, before doing a commit.
 
##### Software

* camtasia
* https://github.com/justinfrankel/licecap (for simple .gif that you can stitch together in video...)
* screencastomatic
* Add more recommendations in Mattermost/NC Stack Overflow Questions
 
##### Guidelines for both multimedia formats:

* Keep the content simple - A regular software engineer without knowing anything about your tool should be able to follow you

##### Guidelines for screencasts (video)

* Mention your name, unity ID and the tool/source code which you will be testing/demoing when you begin
* Use a headset microphone for good quality audio recording.
* Create a script and rehearse that script

##### Guidelines for making a screencast:

* Consider investing in a nicer [video and mic setup](http://pgbovine.net/video-recording-setup.htm).
* https://wiki.duraspace.org/plugins/viewsource/viewpagesrc.action?pageId=30218666 (also good suggestions for podcasts)
* From http://www.screencast.com/help/tutorial.aspx?id=403
* Practice on screen movements as they can appear jerky when viewing but not as a user.
* Script out complex parts.
* Speak clearly and enunciate, also, have good sound quality.
* Background noise can be distracting.
