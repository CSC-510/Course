# Course

CSC 510 introduces students to the discipline of developing useful and high-quality software-based systems. Students will be exposed to the techniques needed for the practice of effective software engineering as well as the skills required to succeed as a software professional. 

See the [Syllabus](https://github.com/CSC-510/Course/blob/master/Syllabus.md) for details on classroom policies and evaluation.

## Objectives

By the end of the course, you should be able to accomplish the following objectives:

* Implement software engineering practices in a team project.
* Identify practices related to software process.
* Decide how to test a system and measure coverage.
* Compare and contrast design techniques and architectural patterns.
* Measure the quality of software code.
* Build tools for supporting software engineering tasks.
* Evaluate evidence related to a software practice.
* Identify configuration management practices for improving maintanance of software
* Apply deployment practices and patterns.

Students are expected to gain practical exposure to tools, processes, and principles of software engineering through hands-on projects while understanding models and research ideas behind the tools and processes.  Lectures will include workshop style learning experiences, where students get to work on a problemset and receive feedback from the instructor and other classmates.
