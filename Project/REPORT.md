### Presentation

Prepare a 3 minute screencast demonstrating your entire project. Focus on illustrating the problem and the primary uses cases of using the bot. If extra time you can discuss any additional interesting aspect of your project setup like technology, deployment, mocking, or testing.

_This video will be shown in class. Your video shown in class can be considered a "draft", you will have a chance to update it before your final submission. However, you will want to consider using video editing, diagrams, transitions, and high quality audio recording to produce your video.
