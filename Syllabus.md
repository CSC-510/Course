## Prerequisites
Graduate or senior standing with at least 3.0 GPA, good knowledge of at least one high
level programming language.

## Outline

CSC 510 introduces students to the discipline of developing useful and high-quality software-based systems. Students will be exposed to the techniques needed for the practice of effective software engineering as well as the skills required to succeed as a software professional. By the end of the course, you should be able to accomplish the following objectives:

### Objectives

* Implement software engineering practices in a team project.
* Identify practices related to software process.
* Decide how to test a system and measure coverage.
* Compare and contrast design techniques and architectural patterns.
* Measure the quality of software code.
* Build tools for supporting software engineering tasks.
* Evaluate evidence related to a software practice.
* Identify configuration management practices for improving maintanance of software
* Apply deployment practices and patterns.

### Structure

Students are expected to gain practical exposure to tools, processes, and principles of software engineering through hands-on projects while understanding models and research ideas behind the tools and processes.  Lectures will include workshop style learning experiences, where students get to work on a problemset and receive feedback from the instructor and other classmates. 

### Evaluation

Evaluation will be based on homework assignments, workshop attendance, class project, and final exam.
Students are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful and professional manner at all times. Grades will be adjusted if students do not handle themselves in a respectful and professional manner with all members of the teaching staff and with others in the class - both in person and electronically (email, message board posts).

### Homeworks

Homework assignments will be regularly released throughout the semester and reinforce class material. Homeworks are to be completed by individuals.

### Workshops

Workshops are have required attendance and are vital to the course. During a workshop, you'll be guided in using tools and building specific functionality which you will later use for homeworks and project milestones. During the semester, workshops will be randomly selected for attendance. 

* 1 missed workshop, workshop grade = 4
* 2 missed workshops, workshop grade = 2
* 3 missed workshops, workshop grade = 0

### Class Activities

In lecture, in class activities may be requested of students. Students are required to complete these activities in class. Failure to attend class for these activities will result in the following grades:

* 1 missed class activity, class activity grade = 4
* 2 missed class activity, class activity grade = 2
* 3 missed class activity, class activity grade = 0

### Late Arrivals

Missing the first three consecutive classes will result in failure of the course.

### Project

The primary objective of the course will be to allow students to gain experience in applying software engineering practices in a team.  Throughout the semester, students are expected to complete a component of the project by each milestone deadline.

##### Milestones

Details on requirements for milestones will be released throughout the course.  A student's project should demonstrate the following components by the milestone deadline:

* DESIGN
* BOT
* SERVICE
* DEPLOY
* REPORT

### Late Policy
No late assignments will be accepted. Many of your assignments will be collaborative
effort with other members of your group. Thus, late papers by one member
of the group will affect the entire group. The due date for assignments will be
posted on the assignment and will generally be submitted electronically.

### Regrading
Should you discover what you think is an error in grading or attendance, you have only TWO WEEKS after the grades are returned to you (on paper or via Moodle) to request a re-grade. After that point, you cannot appeal your grade. To request a re-grade, first see your TA (who did the grading) and see if you can get it resolved. If you are still unsatisfied, you should then contact the professor.

### Teaching Philosophy
We will make use of intensive classroom activities and readings. You will be expected to participate actively in discussions. On any given issue, you may be asked to summarize and criticize reading assignments from the text or articles that you have read for your assignments and projects. We view the web as a valuable
resource. Our course website will serve as our ”information system” this semester; you will be expected to visit the site on a daily basis for updates and to obtain your homework / project assignments.
Only you can learn. As the instructors, we can only guide and assist you. Thus, all of the class activities are aimed at helping you learn.

### Academic Integrity
The course will follow all NCSU academic [integrity regulations](http://www.ncsu.edu/provost/academic_policies). All students are expected to maintain traditional standards of academic integrity by giving proper credit for all work. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued. A student shall be guilty of a violation of academic integrity if he or she represents the work of others as his or her own or aid another’s misrepresentation.
Any violation associated with a homework/lab assignment, project
deliverable, examination or quiz will result in a failing grade for the course. Such violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct, which may impose penalties beyond those by the instructors.

We encourage you to read the ACM Code of Ethics, particularly Sections 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 2.2 and 2.4. (http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html)

### Equity Policy

All persons, regardless of age, race, religion, gender, physical disability or sexual orientation shall have equal opportunity without harassment in this course. Any harassment should be reported immediately to the instructor.

Students are responsible for reviewing the NC State University PRR’s which pertains to their course rights and responsibilities:

#### Code of Student Conduct 

Students are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful and professional manner at all times. Grades will be adjusted if students do not handle themselves in a respectful and professional manner with all members of the teaching staff and with others in the class - both in person and electronically (email, message board posts).

### Students with Disabilities
The course will follow all NCSU regulations relevant to students with disabilities. Any students requiring additional assistance due to disabilities (e.g., learning disabilities), should contact the professor during the first week of the semester. Students requiring extra time for examinations and quizzes are asked to make
arrangements at least three days in advance. You may contact the NCSU Disability Services for Students Office regarding campus services at the Student Health Center for more information and assistance (http://www.ncsu.edu/dso/students/).

### Course Evaluation

Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of class. Students will receive an email message directing them to a website where they can login using their Unity ID and complete evaluations. All evaluations are confidential; instructors will never know how any one student responded to any question, and students will never know the ratings for any particular instructors.
